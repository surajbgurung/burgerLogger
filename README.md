# Eat-Da-Burger!

* Eat-Da-Burger! is created with the help of MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!),in MVC pattern.
* it's a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, it will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* it will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
